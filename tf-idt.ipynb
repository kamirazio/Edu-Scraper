      "by the science of moving dots. So what are these dots? Well, it's all of us. And we're moving in our homes,\n",
      "in our offices, as we shop and travel throughout our cities\n",
      "and around the world. And wouldn't it be great\n",
      "if we could understand all this movement? If we could find patterns and meaning\n",
      "and insight in it. And luckily for us, we live in a time where we're incredibly good\n",
      "at capturing information about ourselves. So whether it's through\n",
      "sensors or videos, or apps, we can track our movement\n",
      "with incredibly fine detail. So it turns out one of the places\n",
      "where we have the best data about movement is sports. So whether it's basketball or baseball,\n",
      "or football or the other football, we're instrumenting our stadiums\n",
      "and our players to track their movements every fraction of a second. So what we're doing\n",
      "is turning our athletes into -- you probably guessed it -- moving dots. So we've got mountains of moving dots\n",
      "and like most raw data, it's hard to deal with\n",
      "and not that interesting. But there are things that, for example,\n",
      "basketball coaches want to know. And the problem is they can't know them\n",
      "because they'd have to watch every second of every game, remember it and process it. And a person can't do that, but a machine can. The problem is a machine can't see\n",
      "the game with the eye of a coach. At least they couldn't until now. So what have we taught the machine to see? So, we started simply. We taught it things like passes,\n",
      "shots and rebounds. Things that most casual fans would know. And then we moved on to things\n",
      "slightly more complicated. Events like post-ups,\n",
      "and pick-and-rolls, and isolations. And if you don't know them, that's okay.\n",
      "Most casual players probably do. Now, we've gotten to a point where today,\n",
      "the machine understands complex events like down screens and wide pins. Basically things only professionals know. So we have taught a machine to see\n",
      "with the eyes of a coach. So how have we been able to do this? If I asked a coach to describe\n",
      "something like a pick-and-roll, they would give me a description, and if I encoded that as an algorithm,\n",
      "it would be terrible. The pick-and-roll happens to be this dance\n",
      "in basketball between four players, two on offense and two on defense. And here's kind of how it goes. So there's the guy on offense\n",
      "without the ball the ball and he goes next to the guy\n",
      "guarding the guy with the ball, and he kind of stays there and they both move and stuff happens,\n",
      "and ta-da, it's a pick-and-roll. (Laughter) So that is also an example\n",
      "of a terrible algorithm. So, if the player who's the interferer --\n",
      "he's called the screener -- goes close by, but he doesn't stop, it's probably not a pick-and-roll. Or if he does stop,\n",
      "but he doesn't stop close enough, it's probably not a pick-and-roll. Or, if he does go close by\n",
      "and he does stop but they do it under the basket,\n",
      "it's probably not a pick-and-roll. Or I could be wrong,\n",
      "they could all be pick-and-rolls. It really depends on the exact timing,\n",
      "the distances, the locations, and that's what makes it hard. So, luckily, with machine learning,\n",
      "we can go beyond our own ability to describe the things we know. So how does this work?\n",
      "Well, it's by example. So we go to the machine and say,\n",
      "\"Good morning, machine. Here are some pick-and-rolls,\n",
      "and here are some things that are not. Please find a way to tell the difference.\" And the key to all of this is to find\n",
      "features that enable it to separate. So if I was going\n",
      "to teach it the difference between an apple and orange, I might say, \"Why don't you\n",
      "use color or shape?\" And the problem that we're solving is,\n",
      "what are those things? What are the key features that let a computer navigate\n",
      "the world of moving dots? So figuring out all these relationships\n",
      "with relative and absolute location, distance, timing, velocities -- that's really the key to the science\n",
      "of moving dots, or as we like to call it, spatiotemporal pattern recognition,\n",
      "in academic vernacular. Because the first thing is,\n",
      "you have to make it sound hard -- because it is. The key thing is, for NBA coaches,\n",
      "it's not that they want to know whether a pick-and-roll happened or not. It's that they want to know\n",
      "how it happened. And why is it so important to them?\n",
      "So here's a little insight. It turns out in modern basketball, this pick-and-roll is perhaps\n",
      "the most important play. And knowing how to run it,\n",
      "and knowing how to defend it, is basically a key to winning\n",
      "and losing most games. So it turns out that this dance\n",
      "has a great many variations and identifying the variations\n",
      "is really the thing that matters, and that's why we need this\n",
      "to be really, really good. So, here's an example. There are two offensive\n",
      "and two defensive players, getting ready to do\n",
      "the pick-and-roll dance. So the guy with ball\n",
      "can either take, or he can reject. His teammate can either roll or pop. The guy guarding the ball\n",
      "can either go over or under. His teammate can either show\n",
      "or play up to touch, or play soft and together they can\n",
      "either switch or blitz and I didn't know\n",
      "most of these things when I started and it would be lovely if everybody moved\n",
      "according to those arrows. It would make our lives a lot easier,\n",
      "but it turns out movement is very messy. People wiggle a lot and getting\n",
      "these variations identified with very high accuracy, both in precision and recall, is tough because that's what it takes to get\n",
      "a professional coach to believe in you. And despite all the difficulties\n",
      "with the right spatiotemporal features we have been able to do that. Coaches trust our ability of our machine\n",
      "to identify these variations. We're at the point where\n",
      "almost every single contender for an NBA championship this year is using our software, which is built\n",
      "on a machine that understands the moving dots of basketball. So not only that, we have given advice\n",
      "that has changed strategies that have helped teams win\n",
      "very important games, and it's very exciting because you have\n",
      "coaches who've been in the league for 30 years that are willing to take\n",
      "advice from a machine. And it's very exciting,\n",
      "it's much more than the pick-and-roll. Our computer started out\n",
      "with simple things and learned more and more complex things and now it knows so many things. Frankly, I don't understand\n",
      "much of what it does, and while it's not that special\n",
      "to be smarter than me, we were wondering,\n",
      "can a machine know more than a coach? Can it know more than person could know? And it turns out the answer is yes. The coaches want players\n",
      "to take good shots. So if I'm standing near the basket and there's nobody near me,\n",
      "it's a good shot. If I'm standing far away surrounded\n",
      "by defenders, that's generally a bad shot. But we never knew how good \"good\" was,\n",
      "or how bad \"bad\" was quantitatively. Until now. So what we can do, again,\n",
      "using spatiotemporal features, we looked at every shot. We can see: Where is the shot?\n",
      "What's the angle to the basket? Where are the defenders standing?\n",
      "What are their distances? What are their angles? For multiple defenders, we can look\n",
      "at how the player's moving and predict the shot type. We can look at all their velocities\n",
      "and we can build a model that predicts what is the likelihood that this shot\n",
      "would go in under these circumstances? So why is this important? We can take something that was shooting, which was one thing before,\n",
      "and turn it into two things: the quality of the shot\n",
      "and the quality of the shooter. So here's a bubble chart,\n",
      "because what's TED without a bubble chart? (Laughter) Those are NBA players. The size is the size of the player\n",
      "and the color is the position. On the x-axis,\n",
      "we have the shot probability. People on the left take difficult shots, on the right, they take easy shots. On the [y-axis] is their shooting ability. People who are good are at the top,\n",
      "bad at the bottom. So for example, if there was a player who generally made\n",
      "47 percent of their shots, that's all you knew before. But today, I can tell you that player\n",
      "takes shots that an average NBA player would make 49 percent of the time, and they are two percent worse. And the reason that's important\n",
      "is that there are lots of 47s out there. And so it's really important to know if the 47 that you're considering\n",
      "giving 100 million dollars to is a good shooter who takes bad shots or a bad shooter who takes good shots. Machine understanding doesn't just change\n",
      "how we look at players, it changes how we look at the game. So there was this very exciting game\n",
      "a couple of years ago, in the NBA finals. Miami was down by three,\n",
      "there was 20 seconds left. They were about to lose the championship. A gentleman named LeBron James\n",
      "came up and he took a three to tie. He missed. His teammate Chris Bosh got a rebound, passed it to another teammate\n",
      "named Ray Allen. He sank a three. It went into overtime. They won the game.\n",
      "They won the championship. It was one of the most exciting\n",
      "games in basketball. And our ability to know\n",
      "the shot probability for every player at every second, and the likelihood of them getting\n",
      "a rebound at every second can illuminate this moment in a way\n",
      "that we never could before. Now unfortunately,\n",
      "I can't show you that video. But for you, we recreated that moment at our weekly basketball game\n",
      "about 3 weeks ago. (Laughter) And we recreated the tracking\n",
      "that led to the insights. So, here is us.\n",
      "This is Chinatown in Los Angeles, a park we play at every week, and that's us recreating\n",
      "the Ray Allen moment and all the tracking\n",
      "that's associated with it. So, here's the shot. I'm going to show you that moment and all the insights of that moment. The only difference is, instead\n",
      "of the professional players, it's us, and instead of a professional\n",
      "announcer, it's me. So, bear with me. Miami. Down three. Twenty seconds left. Jeff brings up the ball. Josh catches, puts up a three! [Calculating shot probability] [Shot quality] [Rebound probability] Won't go! [Rebound probability] Rebound, Noel. Back to Daria. [Shot quality] Her three-pointer -- bang! Tie game with five seconds left. The crowd goes wild. (Laughter) That's roughly how it happened. (Applause) Roughly. (Applause) That moment had about a nine percent\n",
      "chance of happening in the NBA and we know that\n",
      "and a great many other things. I'm not going to tell you how many times\n",
      "it took us to make that happen. (Laughter) Okay, I will! It was four. (Laughter) Way to go, Daria. But the important thing about that video and the insights we have for every second\n",
      "of every NBA game -- it's not that. It's the fact you don't have to be\n",
      "a professional team to track movement. You do not have to be a professional\n",

      "pick-and-rolls, a machine can identify\n",
      "the moment and let me know when my daughter takes her first steps. Which could literally be happening\n",
      "any second now. Perhaps we can learn to better use\n",

      "that I was the coach who left the most important\n",
      "mark on his career. (Laughter) The truth is, when I started working\n",
      "at the institute for the blind, I was surprised by a lot of things. A lot of the things they did,\n",
      "I never imagined they could: they swam, did exercise, played cards. They drank mate, and could pour it without burning themselves in the process. But when I saw them playing soccer -- that was amazing. They had a dirt field,\n",
      "rusty goalposts and broken nets. The blind who attended the institute\n",
      "would play their games there, just like I did at a field near my house. But they played without being able to see. The ball made a sound\n",
      "so they could locate it. They had a guide\n",
      "behind the rival team's goal to know where to kick the ball. And they used eye masks. There were guys\n",
      "who could still see a little, and they wore eye masks\n",
      "so everyone was equal. When I was more at ease with them,\n",
      "I asked for a mask myself. I put it on and tried to play. I had played soccer all my life. This is where it got even more amazing: within two seconds, I didn't know\n",
      "where I was standing. I had studied physical education\n",
      "because I loved high performance. I started working\n",
      "at the institute by chance. My other job was with the Argentinian\n",
      "National Rowing Team, and I felt that was my thing. Here, everything was twice as hard. I'll never forget the first day\n",
      "I did the warm-up with the team. I lined them up in front of me -- I used to do that with the rowing team -- and I said, \"OK, everyone\n",
      "bend down,\" going like this. When I looked up, two guys were seated, three were lying down\n",
      "and others were squatting. (Laughter) How could I do here\n",
      "the same things I was doing there? It took me a while. I started looking for tools\n",
      "to learn from them, from the teachers who worked with them. I learned I couldn't explain a play\n",
      "on a chalkboard like a coach does, but I could use a plastic tray\n",
      "and some bottle caps so they could follow me by way of touch. I also learned they could run on a track if I ran with them, holding a rope. So we started looking for volunteers\n",
      "to help us run with them. I was enjoying it, and finding purpose and meaning\n",
      "in what we were doing. It was hard at first,\n",
      "it was uncomfortable, but I decided to overcome the discomfort. And there came a time when it became the most\n",
      "fascinating job I'd ever had. I think that's when I wondered: Why couldn't we be\n",
      "a high-performance team as well? Of course, one thing was missing: I needed to find out what they wanted, the real protagonists of this story. Three hours of training,\n",
      "playing soccer on that field, were not going to be enough. We would have to train differently. We started to train harder,\n",
      "and the results were great; they asked for more. I came to understand\n",
      "that they, too, wondered why they couldn't do high-performance. When we felt ready,\n",
      "we knocked at CENARD's door. CENARD is the National Center\n",
      "for High-Performance Sports here in Argentina. It was hard to get them\n",
      "to hear what we had to say. But it was considerably more difficult to get the other athletes training there\n",
      "to consider us their equals. In fact, they would let us use the field only when no other teams were using it. And we were known as \"the blind ones.\" Not everyone knew\n",
      "exactly what we were doing there. The 2006 World Championship\n",
      "was a turning point in the team's history. It was held in Buenos Aires\n",
      "for the first time. It was our chance to show everyone what we had been doing all that time. We made it to the finals. We were growing as a team. It was us against Brazil in the finals. They were the best team in the tournament. They won every game by a landslide. Hardly anyone believed\n",
      "we could win that game. Hardly anyone -- except for us. During pre-game meetings, in the locker room, during each warm-up, it smelled of victory. I swear that smell exists. I smelled it several times with the team, but I remember it in particular,\n",
      "the day before we played that final. The Argentine Football Association\n",
      "had opened their doors to us. We were training at AFA, where Verón, Higuain and Messi trained. For the first time ever, we felt like a true national team. At 7:30pm, the day before the game, we were in the lounge discussing strategy, and a waiter knocks on the door,\n",
      "interrupting our conversation. He suggested we go to church. He came to invite us to church. I tried to get rid of him,\n",
      "saying it wasn't a good time, that we better leave it for another day. He kept insisting, asking me to please\n",
      "let him take the guys to church, because that day, a pastor\n",
      "who performed miracles would be there. I was slightly afraid to ask\n",
      "what type of miracles he meant, and he replied nonchalantly, \"Coach, let me take\n",
      "the team to the church, and when we return, I guarantee\n",
      "that half of them will be able to see.\" (Laughter) Some of the guys laughed, but imagine being a blind person\n",
      "and someone says that to you. I didn't know what to say. I said nothing; it was an awkward silence. I didn't want to make him feel bad, because he truly believed\n",
      "this could happen. One of the players saved me, when he stood up and confidently said, \"Juan,\" -- that was the kid's name -- Gonza already told you\n",
      "it's not the best time to go to church. Besides, let me make this clear: if we go to that church, and I end up\n",
      "being able to see when we return, I will beat you so hard\n",
      "if I can't play tomorrow.\" (Laughter) (Applause) Juan left, laughing in resignation, and we continued with our pregame talk. That night when I went to sleep, I began to dream\n",
      "about the next day's game, imagining what could happen,\n",
      "how we would play. And that's when I noticed\n",
      "that smell of victory I mentioned a while ago. And it's because\n",
      "at that moment, I thought: if the other players had the same desire\n",
      "as Diego going into the game, it was impossible for us not to win. The next day was going to be wonderful. We got up at 9am, the game was at 7pm, and we were already eager to play. We left AFA, and the bus was full\n",
      "of flags that people had given to us. We were talking about the game, and we could hear people\n",
      "honking and cheering, \"Go Murciélagos! Today's the day!\n",
      "The final challenge!\" The guys asked me, \"Do they know us?\n",
      "Do they know we're playing?\" Some people followed the bus to CENARD. We arrived and found an amazing scene. In the corridor leading\n",
      "from the locker room to the game field, I was walking with Silvio, who was holding onto my shoulder,\n",
      "so I could guide him. Fortunately, there were\n",
      "no gates along the way. (Laughter) When we reached the field,\n",
      "he asked me about everything. He didn't want to miss a single detail. He said, \"Tell me what you see,\n",
      "tell me who's playing the drums.\" I tried to explain what was happening\n",
      "with as much detail as possible. I told him, \"The stands are packed,\n",
      "a lot of people couldn't get in, there are blue and white balloons\n",
      "all over the field, they're opening a giant Argentine flag\n",
      "that covers the entire grandstand.\" Suddenly, he cuts me off and says, \"Do you see a flag that says 'San Pedro'?\" That's the city where he lives. I started looking into the stands and I spotted a little white flag with lettering done\n",
      "in black spray paint, that read: \"Silvio, your family\n",
      "and all of San Pedro are here.\" I told him that and he replied, \"That's my mom, tell me where\n",
      "she is, I want to I wave at her.\" I pointed him toward the flag and showed him with his arm\n",
      "where they were sitting, and he waved his arms in that direction. About 20 or 30 people stood up\n",
      "and gave him an ovation. When that happened, I saw how his face changed,\n",
      "how moved he was. It was moving for me, too; two seconds later,\n",
      "I had a lump in my throat. It was strange -- I felt both\n",
      "the excitement of what was happening, and the anger and the anguish\n",
      "that he could not see it. A few days later when I told him\n",
      "what I had experienced, he tried to reassure me, saying, \"Gonza, don't feel bad, I could see them. Differently, but I swear to you\n",
      "that I saw them all.\" The game started. We could not fail; it was the final. The audience was quiet, like here, because in soccer for the blind, the public has to be quiet\n",
      "so the players can hear the ball. They're only allowed to cheer\n",
      "when the game is over. And when there were eight minutes to go, the crowd did all the cheering\n",
      "they hadn't done in the first 32 minutes. When pigeon-toed Silvio\n",
      "nailed the ball at an angle, they cheered with all their heart, in an incredible way. Today, if you go to CENARD,\n",
      "you'll see a huge poster on the door, with a photo of our team,\n",
      "Los Murciélagos. They're a model national team,\n",
      "everyone in CENARD knows who they are, and after having won\n",
      "two World Championships and two Paralympic medals, no one doubts they are\n",
      "high-performance athletes. (Applause) (Applause ends) I was lucky to train\n",
      "this team for 10 years, first as a trainer\n",
      "and later as their coach. I feel that they've given me much more than what I've given them. Last year, they asked me to coach\n",
      "another national team, Power Soccer. It's a national team of young men\n",
      "who play soccer in wheelchairs. They use motorized wheelchairs\n",
      "that they drive with a joystick, because they don't have\n",
      "enough strength in their arms to use conventional chairs. They added a bumper to the chair,\n",
      "a safeguard that protects their feet, while allowing them to kick the ball. It's the first time that, instead\n",
      "of being the spectators, they're now the main characters. It's the first time their parents,\n",
      "friends and siblings can see them play. For me, it's a new challenge, with the same discomfort,\n",
      "insecurity, and fear I had when I started working with the blind. But I approach it all\n",
      "from a more experienced position. That's why from day one,\n",
      "I treat them as athletes on the field, and off the field, I try\n",
      "to put myself in their shoes and behave without prejudice, because treating them naturally\n",
      "feels best to them. Both teams play soccer;\n",
      "something once unthinkable for them. They had to adapt the rules to do so. And both teams broke the same rule -- the one that said\n",
      "they couldn't play soccer. When you see them play,\n",
      "you see competition, not disability. The problem starts when the game is over, and they leave the field. Then they step in to play our game, in a society whose rules\n",
      "don't really take them into account or care for them. I learned from sports that disability greatly depends on\n",
      "the rules of the game. I believe that if we change\n",
      "some of the rules of our game, we can make life a little easier for them. We all know there are people\n",
      "with disabilities; we see them daily. But by having no direct contact with them, we're not aware of the problems\n",
      "they face every day, like how hard it is for them\n",
      "to get on a bus, find a job, take the subway or cross the street. It's true that there is an increasing\n",
      "social responsibility regarding the inclusion\n",
      "of people with disabilities. But I think it's still not enough. I think change needs to come\n",
      "from every one of us. First, by leaving behind\n",
      "our indifference toward the disabled, and then by respecting the rules\n",
      "that do take them into account. They are few, but they do exist. I cracked a blind man's head\n",
      "open -- El Pulga's head. I can assure you these two teams\n",

      "Welcome to this TED Dialogues. It's the first of a series\n",
      "that's going to be done in response to the current\n",
      "political upheaval. I don't know about you; I've become quite concerned about\n",
      "the growing divisiveness in this country and in the world. No one's listening to each other. Right? They aren't. I mean, it feels like we need\n",
      "a different kind of conversation, one that's based on -- I don't know,\n",
      "on reason, listening, on understanding, on a broader context. That's at least what we're going to try\n",
      "in these TED Dialogues, starting today. And we couldn't have anyone with us who I'd be more excited to kick this off. This is a mind right here that thinks\n",
      "pretty much like no one else on the planet, I would hasten to say. I'm serious. (Yuval Noah Harari laughs) I'm serious. He synthesizes history\n",
      "with underlying ideas in a way that kind of takes\n",
      "your breath away. So, some of you will know\n",
      "this book, \"Sapiens.\" Has anyone here read \"Sapiens\"? (Applause) I mean, I could not put it down. The way that he tells the story of mankind through big ideas that really make you\n",
      "think differently -- it's kind of amazing. And here's the follow-up, which I think is being published\n",
      "in the US next week. YNH: Yeah, next week. CA: \"Homo Deus.\" Now, this is the history\n",
      "of the next hundred years. I've had a chance to read it. It's extremely dramatic, and I daresay, for some people,\n",
      "quite alarming. It's a must-read. And honestly, we couldn't have\n",
      "someone better to help make sense of what on Earth\n",
      "is happening in the world right now. So a warm welcome, please,\n",
      "to Yuval Noah Harari. (Applause) It's great to be joined by our friends\n",
      "on Facebook and around the Web. Hello, Facebook. And all of you, as I start\n",
      "asking questions of Yuval, come up with your own questions, and not necessarily about\n",
      "the political scandal du jour, but about the broader understanding\n",
      "of: Where are we heading? You ready? OK, we're going to go. So here we are, Yuval: New York City, 2017,\n",
      "there's a new president in power, and shock waves rippling around the world. What on Earth is happening? YNH: I think the basic thing that happened is that we have lost our story. Humans think in stories, and we try to make sense of the world\n",
      "by telling stories. And for the last few decades, we had a very simple\n",
      "and very attractive story about what's happening in the world. And the story said that,\n",
      "oh, what's happening is that the economy is being globalized, politics is being liberalized, and the combination of the two\n",
      "will create paradise on Earth, and we just need to keep on\n",
      "globalizing the economy and liberalizing the political system, and everything will be wonderful. And 2016 is the moment when a very large segment,\n",
      "even of the Western world, stopped believing in this story. For good or bad reasons --\n",
      "it doesn't matter. People stopped believing in the story, and when you don't have a story,\n",
      "you don't understand what's happening. CA: Part of you believes that that story\n",
      "was actually a very effective story. It worked. YNH: To some extent, yes. According to some measurements, we are now in the best time ever for humankind. Today, for the first time in history, more people die from eating too much\n",
      "than from eating too little, which is an amazing achievement. (Laughter) Also for the first time in history, more people die from old age\n",
      "than from infectious diseases, and violence is also down. For the first time in history, more people commit suicide\n",
      "than are killed by crime and terrorism and war put together. Statistically, you are\n",
      "your own worst enemy. At least, of all the people in the world, you are most likely\n",
      "to be killed by yourself -- (Laughter) which is, again,\n",
      "very good news, compared -- (Laughter) compared to the level of violence\n",
      "that we saw in previous eras. CA: But this process\n",
      "of connecting the world ended up with a large group of people\n",
      "kind of feeling left out, and they've reacted. And so we have this bombshell that's sort of ripping\n",
      "through the whole system. I mean, what do you make\n",
      "of what's happened? It feels like the old way\n",
      "that people thought of politics, the left-right divide,\n",
      "has been blown up and replaced. How should we think of this? YNH: Yeah, the old 20th-century\n",
      "political model of left versus right is now largely irrelevant, and the real divide today\n",
      "is between global and national, global or local. And you see it again all over the world that this is now the main struggle. We probably need completely\n",
      "new political models and completely new ways\n",
      "of thinking about politics. In essence, what you can say\n",
      "is that we now have global ecology, we have a global economy\n",
      "but we have national politics, and this doesn't work together. This makes the political\n",
      "system ineffective, because it has no control\n",
      "over the forces that shape our life. And you have basically two solutions\n",
      "to this imbalance: either de-globalize the economy\n",
      "and turn it back into a national economy, or globalize the political system. CA: So some, I guess\n",
      "many liberals out there view Trump and his government\n",
      "as kind of irredeemably bad, just awful in every way. Do you see any underlying narrative\n",
      "or political philosophy in there that is at least worth understanding? How would you articulate that philosophy? Is it just the philosophy of nationalism? YNH: I think the underlying\n",
      "feeling or idea is that the political system --\n",
      "something is broken there. It doesn't empower\n",
      "the ordinary person anymore. It doesn't care so much\n",
      "about the ordinary person anymore, and I think this diagnosis\n",
      "of the political disease is correct. With regard to the answers,\n",
      "I am far less certain. I think what we are seeing\n",
      "is the immediate human reaction: if something doesn't work, let's go back. And you see it all over the world, that people, almost nobody\n",
      "in the political system today, has any future-oriented vision\n",
      "of where humankind is going. Almost everywhere,\n",
      "you see retrograde vision: \"Let's make America great again,\" like it was great -- I don't know --\n",
      "in the '50s, in the '80s, sometime, let's go back there. And you go to Russia\n",
      "a hundred years after Lenin, Putin's vision for the future is basically, ah, let's go back\n",
      "to the Tsarist empire. And in Israel, where I come from, the hottest political vision\n",
      "of the present is: \"Let's build the temple again.\" So let's go back 2,000 years backwards. So people are thinking\n",
      "sometime in the past we've lost it, and sometimes in the past, it's like\n",
      "you've lost your way in the city, and you say OK, let's go back\n",
      "to the point where I felt secure and start again. I don't think this can work, but a lot of people,\n",
      "this is their gut instinct. CA: But why couldn't it work? \"America First\" is a very\n",
      "appealing slogan in many ways. Patriotism is, in many ways,\n",
      "a very noble thing. It's played a role\n",
      "in promoting cooperation among large numbers of people. Why couldn't you have a world\n",
      "organized in countries, all of which put themselves first? YNH: For many centuries,\n",
      "even thousands of years, patriotism worked quite well. Of course, it led to wars an so forth, but we shouldn't focus\n",
      "too much on the bad. There are also many,\n",
      "many positive things about patriotism, and the ability to have\n",
      "a large number of people care about each other, sympathize with one another, and come together for collective action. If you go back to the first nations, so, thousands of years ago, the people who lived along\n",

      "for survival and for prosperity, but all of them also suffered\n",
      "from periodical floods and periodical droughts. And no tribe could really do\n",
      "anything about it, because each of them controlled\n",
      "just a tiny section of the river. And then in a long\n",
      "and complicated process, the tribes coalesced together\n",
      "to form the Chinese nation, which controlled the entire Yellow River and had the ability to bring\n",
      "hundreds of thousands of people together to build dams and canals\n",
      "and regulate the river and prevent the worst floods and droughts and raise the level\n",
      "of prosperity for everybody. And this worked in many places\n",

      "of global cooperation, nationalism is just not on the right level\n",
      "to tackle the problems, whether it's climate change\n",
      "or whether it's technological disruption. CA: So it was a beautiful idea in a world where most of the action,\n",
      "most of the issues, took place on national scale, but your argument is that the issues\n",
      "that matter most today no longer take place on a national scale\n",
      "but on a global scale. YNH: Exactly. All the major problems\n",
      "of the world today are global in essence, and they cannot be solved unless through some kind\n",
      "of global cooperation. It's not just climate change, which is, like, the most obvious\n",

      "that the start point of a lot of the anger\n",
      "that's propelled us to where we are is because of the legitimate\n",

      "that people are furious about that. And in general, they have blamed\n",
      "globalism, global elites, for doing this to them\n",
      "without asking their permission, and that seems like\n",
      "a legitimate complaint. But what I hear you saying\n",
      "is that -- so a key question is: What is the real cause of job loss,\n",
      "both now and going forward? To the extent that it's about globalism, then the right response,\n",
      "yes, is to shut down borders and keep people out\n",
      "and change trade agreements and so forth. But you're saying, I think, that actually the bigger cause of job loss\n",
      "is not going to be that at all. It's going to originate\n",
      "in technological questions, and we have no chance of solving that unless we operate as a connected world. YNH: Yeah, I think that, I don't know about the present,\n",
      "but looking to the future, it's not the Mexicans or Chinese\n",
      "who will take the jobs from the people in Pennsylvania, it's the robots and algorithms. So unless you plan to build a big wall\n",

      "effective way of frightening people -- (Laughter) and galvanizing people: \"The robots will take your jobs!\" And nobody used that line. And it made me afraid, because it meant\n",
      "that no matter what happens in universities and laboratories, and there, there is already\n",
      "an intense debate about it, but in the mainstream political system\n",
      "and among the general public, people are just unaware that there could be an immense\n",
      "technological disruption -- not in 200 years,\n",
      "but in 10, 20, 30 years -- and we have to do something about it now, partly because most of what we teach\n",
      "children today in school or in college is going to be completely irrelevant\n",

      "what to teach the young people. CA: Yeah, no, absolutely. You've often written about\n",
      "moments in history where humankind has ...\n",
      "entered a new era, unintentionally. Decisions have been made,\n",
      "technologies have been developed, and suddenly the world has changed, possibly in a way\n",
      "that's worse for everyone. So one of the examples\n",
      "you give in \"Sapiens\" is just the whole agricultural revolution, which, for an actual person\n",
      "tilling the fields, they just picked up a 12-hour\n",

      "and a much more interesting lifestyle. (Laughter) So are we at another possible\n",
      "phase change here, where we kind of sleepwalk into a future\n",
      "that none of us actually wants? YNH: Yes, very much so. During the agricultural revolution, what happened is that immense\n",
      "technological and economic revolution empowered the human collective, but when you look at actual\n",
      "individual lives, the life of a tiny elite\n",
      "became much better, and the lives of the majority of people\n",
      "became considerably worse. And this can happen again\n",
      "in the 21st century. No doubt the new technologies\n",
      "will empower the human collective. But we may end up again with a tiny elite reaping\n",
      "all the benefits, taking all the fruits, and the masses of the population\n",
      "finding themselves worse than they were before, certainly much worse than this tiny elite. CA: And those elites\n",
      "might not even be human elites. They might be cyborgs or -- YNH: Yeah, they could be\n",
      "enhanced super humans. They could be cyborgs. They could be completely\n",
      "nonorganic elites. They could even be\n",
      "non-conscious algorithms. What we see now in the world\n",
      "is authority shifting away from humans to algorithms. More and more decisions --\n",
      "about personal lives, about economic matters,\n",
      "about political matters -- are actually being taken by algorithms. If you ask the bank for a loan, chances are your fate is decided\n",
      "by an algorithm, not by a human being. And the general impression\n",
      "is that maybe Homo sapiens just lost it. The world is so complicated,\n",
      "there is so much data, things are changing so fast, that this thing that evolved\n",

      "of information and data -- it just can't handle the realities\n",
      "of the 21st century, and the only thing\n",
      "that may be able to handle it is big-data algorithms. So no wonder more and more authority\n",
      "is shifting from us to the algorithms. CA: So we're in New York City\n",

      "he doesn't believe in that. So in a way, your most powerful argument, you can't actually use to make this case. YNH: Yeah, I think with climate change, at first sight, it's quite surprising that there is a very close correlation between nationalism and climate change. I mean, almost always, the people\n",
      "who deny climate change are nationalists. And at first sight, you think: Why? What's the connection? Why don't you have socialists\n",

      "to climate change. If you want to be a nationalist\n",
      "in the 21st century, you have to deny the problem. If you accept the reality of the problem,\n",
      "then you must accept that, yes, there is still room in the world\n",

      "for having special loyalties and obligations towards your own people,\n",
      "towards your own country. I don't think anybody is really\n",
      "thinking of abolishing that. But in order to confront climate change, we need additional loyalties\n",
      "and commitments to a level beyond the nation. And that should not be impossible, because people can have\n",

      "to humankind as a whole? Of course, there are occasions\n",

      "get them coming, too. Howard Morgan: One of the things that has\n",
      "clearly made a huge difference in this country and other countries is the income distribution inequality, the dramatic change\n",
      "in income distribution in the US from what it was 50 years ago, and around the world. Is there anything we can do\n",
      "to affect that? Because that gets at a lot\n",
      "of the underlying causes. YNH: So far I haven't heard a very\n",
      "good idea about what to do about it, again, partly because most ideas\n",
      "remain on the national level, and the problem is global. I mean, one idea that we hear\n",
      "quite a lot about now is universal basic income. But this is a problem. I mean, I think it's a good start, but it's a problematic idea because\n",
      "it's not clear what \"universal\" is and it's not clear what \"basic\" is. Most people when they speak\n",
      "about universal basic income, they actually mean national basic income. But the problem is global. Let's say that you have AI and 3D printers\n",
      "taking away millions of jobs in Bangladesh, from all the people who make\n",

      "to unemployed Bangladeshis? If you believe that,\n",
      "you can just as well believe that Santa Claus will come\n",
      "and solve the problem. So unless we have really universal\n",
      "and not national basic income, the deep problems\n",
      "are not going to go away. And also it's not clear what basic is, because what are basic human needs? A thousand years ago,\n",

      "is this basic income. So what's part of it is a very,\n",
      "very difficult ethical question. CA: There's a bunch of questions\n",

      "as the story is unfolding. Now we can take these responses and compare them to the responses\n",
      "in other listeners in the same brain area. And we can ask: How similar are the responses\n",
      "across all listeners? So here you can see five listeners. And we start to scan their brains\n",
      "before the story starts, when they're simply lying in the dark\n",
      "and waiting for the story to begin. As you can see, the brain area is going up and down\n",
      "in each one of them, but the responses are very different, and not in sync. However, immediately\n",
      "as the story is starting, something amazing is happening. (Audio) JO: So I'm banging out my story\n",
      "and I know it's good, and then I start to make it -- UH: Suddenly, you can see\n",
      "that the responses in all of the subjects lock to the story, and now they are going up and down\n",
      "in a very similar way across all listeners. And in fact, this is exactly\n",
      "what is happening now in your brains when you listen to my sound speaking. We call this effect \"neural entrainment.\" And to explain to you\n",
      "what is neural entrainment, let me first explain\n",
      "what is physical entrainment. So, we'll look and see five metronomes. Think of these five metronomes\n",
      "as five brains. And similar to the listeners\n",
      "before the story starts, these metronomes are going to click, but they're going to click out of phase. (Clicking) Now see what will happen\n",
      "when I connect them together by placing them on these two cylinders. (Clicking) Now these two cylinders start to rotate. This rotation vibration\n",
      "is going through the wood and is going to couple\n",
      "all the metronomes together. And now listen to the click. (Synchronized clicking) This is what you call\n",
      "physical entrainment. Now let's go back to the brain and ask: What's driving this neural entrainment? Is it simply the sounds\n",
      "that the speaker is producing? Or maybe it's the words. Or maybe it's the meaning\n",
      "that the speaker is trying to convey. So to test it, we did\n",
      "the following experiment. First, we took the story\n",
      "and played it backwards. And that preserved many\n",
      "of the original auditory features, but removed the meaning. And it sounds something like that. (Audio) JO: (Unintelligible) And we flashed colors in the two brains to indicate brain areas that respond\n",
      "very similarly across people. And as you can see, this incoming sound induced entrainment\n",
      "or alignment in all of the brains in auditory cortices\n",
      "that process the sounds, but it didn't spread\n",
      "deeper into the brain. Now we can take these sounds\n",
      "and build words out of it. So if we take Jim O'Grady\n",
      "and scramble the words, we'll get a list of words. (Audio) JO: ... an animal ...\n",
      "assorted facts ... and right on ... pie man ...\n",
      "potentially ... my stories UH: And you can see that these words\n",
      "start to induce alignment in early language areas,\n",
      "but not more than that. Now we can take the words\n",
      "and start to build sentences out of them. (Audio) JO: And they recommend\n",
      "against crossing that line. He says: \"Dear Jim,\n",
      "Good story. Nice details. Didn't she only know\n",
      "about him through me?\" UH: Now you can see that the responses\n",
      "in all the language areas that process the incoming language become aligned or similar\n",
      "across all listeners. However, only when we use\n",
      "the full, engaging, coherent story do the responses spread\n",
      "deeper into the brain into higher-order areas, which include the frontal cortex\n",
      "and the parietal cortex, and make all of them\n",
      "respond very similarly. And we believe that these responses\n",
      "in higher-order areas are induced or become similar across listeners because of the meaning\n",
      "conveyed by the speaker, and not by words or sound. And if we are right,\n",
      "there's a strong prediction over here if I tell you the exact same ideas using two very different sets of words, your brain responses\n",
      "will still be similar. And to test it, we did\n",
      "the following experiment in my lab. We took the English story and translated it to Russian. Now you have two different sounds\n",
      "and linguistic systems that convey the exact same meaning. And you play the English story\n",
      "to the English listeners and the Russian story\n",
      "to the Russian listeners, and we can compare their responses\n",
      "across the groups. And when we did that, we didn't see\n",
      "responses that are similar in auditory cortices in language, because the language\n",
      "and sound are very different. However, you can see\n",
      "that the responses in high-order areas were still similar\n",
      "across these two groups. We believe this is because they understood\n",
      "the story in a very similar way, as we confirmed, using a test\n",
      "after the story ended. And we think that this alignment\n",
      "is necessary for communication. For example, as you can tell, I am not a native English speaker. I grew up with another language, and the same might be for many\n",
      "of you in the audience. And still, we can communicate. How come? We think we can communicate\n",
      "because we have this common code that presents meaning. So far, I've only talked about\n",
      "what's happening in the listener's brain, in your brain, when\n",
      "you're listening to talks. But what's happening\n",
      "in the speaker's brain, in my brain, when I'm speaking to you? To look in the speaker's brain, we asked the speaker\n",
      "to go into the scanner, we scan his brain and then compare his brain responses\n",
      "to the brain responses of the listeners listening to the story. You have to remember that producing speech\n",
      "and comprehending speech are very different processes. Here we're asking: How similar are they? To our surprise, we saw that all these complex\n",
      "patterns within the listeners actually came from the speaker brain. So production and comprehension\n",
      "rely on very similar processes. And we also found the stronger the similarity\n",
      "between the listener's brain and the speaker's brain, the better the communication. So I know that if you\n",
      "are completely confused now, and I do hope that this is not the case, your brain responses\n",
      "are very different than mine. But I also know that if you really\n",
      "understand me now, then your brain ... and your brain\n",
      "... and your brain are really similar to mine. Now, let's take all\n",
      "this information together and ask: How can we use it to transmit\n",
      "a memory that I have from my brain to your brains? So we did the following experiment. We let people watch,\n",
      "for the first time in their life, a TV episode from the BBC series\n",
      "\"Sherlock,\" while we scanned their brains. And then we asked them\n",
      "to go back to the scanner and tell the story to another person\n",
      "that never watched the movie. So let's be specific. Think about this exact scene, when Sherlock is entering\n",
      "the cab in London driven by the murderer he is looking for. With me, as a viewer, there is a specific brain pattern\n",
      "in my brain when I watch it. Now, the exact same pattern,\n",
      "I can reactivate in my brain again by telling the word:\n",
      "Sherlock, London, murderer. And when I'm transmitting\n",
      "these words to your brains now, you have to reconstruct it in your mind. In fact, we see that pattern\n",
      "emerging now in your brains. And we were really surprised to see that the pattern you have\n",
      "now in your brains when I'm describing to you these scenes would be very similar to the pattern\n",
      "I had when I watched this movie a few months ago in the scanner. This starts to tell you\n",
      "about the mechanism by which we can tell stories\n",
      "and transmit information. Because, for example, now you're listening really hard\n",
      "and trying to understand what I'm saying. And I know that it's not easy. But I hope that at one point\n",
      "in the talk we clicked, and you got me. And I think that in a few hours,\n",
      "a few days, a few months, you're going to meet someone at a party, and you're going to tell him\n",
      "about this lecture, and suddenly it will be as if\n",
      "he is standing now here with us. Now you can see\n",
      "how we can take this mechanism and try to transmit memories\n",
      "and knowledge across people, which is wonderful, right? But our ability to communicate\n",
      "relies on our ability to have common ground. Because, for example, if I'm going to use the British synonym \"hackney carriage\" instead of \"cab,\" I know that I'm going to be misaligned\n",
      "with most of you in the audience. This alignment depends\n",
      "not only on our ability to understand the basic concept; it also depends on our ability to develop\n",
      "common ground and understanding and shared belief systems. Because we know that in many cases, people understand the exact\n",
      "same story in very different ways. So to test it in the lab,\n",
      "we did the following experiment. We took a story by J.D. Salinger, in which a husband lost track\n",
      "of his wife in the middle of a party, and he's calling his best friend, asking,\n",
      "\"Did you see my wife?\" For half of the subjects, we said that the wife was having\n",
      "an affair with the best friend. For the other half, we said that the wife is loyal\n",
      "and the husband is very jealous. This one sentence before the story started was enough to make the brain responses of all the people that believed\n",
      "the wife was having an affair be very similar in these high-order areas and different than the other group. And if one sentence is enough\n",
      "to make your brain similar to people that think like you and very different than people\n",
      "that think differently than you, think how this effect is going\n",
      "to be amplified in real life, when we are all listening\n",
      "to the exact same news item after being exposed\n",
      "day after day after day to different media channels,\n",
      "like Fox News or The New York Times, that give us very different\n",
      "perspectives on reality. So let me summarize. If everything worked as planned tonight, I used my ability to vocalize sound\n",
      "to be coupled to your brains. And I used this coupling to transmit my brain patterns associated\n",
      "with my memories and ideas into your brains. In this, I start to reveal\n",
      "the hidden neural mechanism by which we communicate. And we know that in the future\n",
      "it will enable us to improve and facilitate communication. But these studies also reveal that communication relies\n",
      "on a common ground. And we have to be\n",
      "really worried as a society if we lose this common ground\n",
      "and our ability to speak with people that are slightly different than us because we let a few very strong\n",
      "media channels take control of the mic, and manipulate and control\n",
      "the way we all think. And I'm not sure how to fix it\n",
      "because I'm only a scientist. But maybe one way to do it is to go back to the more\n",
      "natural way of communication, which is a dialogue, in which it's not only me\n",
      "speaking to you now, but a more natural way of talking, in which I am speaking and I am listening, and together we are trying to come\n",
      "to a common ground and new ideas. Because after all, the people we are coupled to\n",
      "define who we are. And our desire to be coupled\n",
      "to another brain is something very basic\n",
      "that starts at a very early age. So let me finish with an example\n",
      "from my own private life that I think is a good example\n",
      "of how coupling to other people is really going to define who we are. This my son Jonathan at a very early age. See how he developed\n",
      "a vocal game together with my wife, only from the desire and pure joy\n",
      "of being coupled to another human being. (Both vocalizing) (Laughter) Now, think how the ability of my son to be coupled to us\n",
      "and other people in his life is going to shape the man\n",
      "he is going to become. And think how you change on a daily basis from the interaction and coupling\n",
      "to other people in your life. So keep being coupled to other people. Keep spreading your ideas, because the sum of all of us\n",
      "together, coupled, is greater than our parts. Thank you. (Applause) \n",

      "Seventy-thousand years ago, our ancestors\n",
      "were insignificant animals. The most important thing to know\n",
      "about prehistoric humans is that they were unimportant. Their impact on the world was not\n",
      "much greater than that of jellyfish or fireflies or woodpeckers. Today, in contrast,\n",
      "we control this planet. And the question is: How did we come from there to here? How did we turn ourselves\n",
      "from insignificant apes, minding their own business\n",
      "in a corner of Africa, into the rulers of planet Earth? Usually, we look for the difference\n",
      "between us and all the other animals on the individual level. We want to believe -- I want to believe -- that there is something special about me, about my body, about my brain, that makes me so superior\n",
      "to a dog or a pig, or a chimpanzee. But the truth is that,\n",
      "on the individual level, I'm embarrassingly similar\n",
      "to a chimpanzee. And if you take me and a chimpanzee\n",
      "and put us together on some lonely island, and we had to struggle for survival\n",
      "to see who survives better, I would definitely place my bet\n",
      "on the chimpanzee, not on myself. And this is not something\n",
      "wrong with me personally. I guess if they took almost any one\n",
      "of you, and placed you alone with a chimpanzee on some island, the chimpanzee would do much better. The real difference between humans\n",
      "and all other animals is not on the individual level; it's on the collective level. Humans control the planet\n",
      "because they are the only animals that can cooperate both flexibly\n",
      "and in very large numbers. Now, there are other animals -- like the social insects,\n",
      "the bees, the ants -- that can cooperate in large numbers,\n",
      "but they don't do so flexibly. Their cooperation is very rigid. There is basically just one way\n",
      "in which a beehive can function. And if there's a new opportunity\n",
      "or a new danger, the bees cannot reinvent\n",
      "the social system overnight. They cannot, for example,\n",
      "execute the queen and establish a republic of bees, or a communist dictatorship\n",
      "of worker bees. Other animals, like the social mammals -- the wolves, the elephants,\n",
      "the dolphins, the chimpanzees -- they can cooperate much more flexibly, but they do so only in small numbers, because cooperation among chimpanzees is based on intimate knowledge,\n",
      "one of the other. I'm a chimpanzee and you're a chimpanzee, and I want to cooperate with you. I need to know you personally. What kind of chimpanzee are you? Are you a nice chimpanzee? Are you an evil chimpanzee? Are you trustworthy? If I don't know you, how can I\n",
      "cooperate with you? The only animal that can combine\n",
      "the two abilities together and cooperate both flexibly\n",
      "and still do so in very large numbers is us, Homo sapiens. One versus one, or even 10 versus 10, chimpanzees might be better than us. But, if you pit 1,000 humans\n",
      "against 1,000 chimpanzees, the humans will win easily,\n",
      "for the simple reason that a thousand chimpanzees\n",
      "cannot cooperate at all. And if you now try to cram\n",
      "100,000 chimpanzees into Oxford Street,\n",
      "or into Wembley Stadium, or Tienanmen Square or the Vatican, you will get chaos, complete chaos. Just imagine Wembley Stadium\n",
      "with 100,000 chimpanzees. Complete madness. In contrast, humans normally\n",
      "gather there in tens of thousands, and what we get is not chaos, usually. What we get is extremely sophisticated\n",
      "and effective networks of cooperation. All the huge achievements\n",
      "of humankind throughout history, whether it's building the pyramids\n",
      "or flying to the moon, have been based not\n",
      "on individual abilities, but on this ability to cooperate\n",
      "flexibly in large numbers. Think even about this very talk\n",
      "that I'm giving now: I'm standing here in front of an audience\n",
      "of about 300 or 400 people, most of you are complete strangers to me. Similarly, I don't really know\n",
      "all the people who have organized and worked on this event. I don't know the pilot\n",
      "and the crew members of the plane that brought me over here,\n",
      "yesterday, to London. I don't know the people\n",
      "who invented and manufactured this microphone and these cameras,\n",
      "which are recording what I'm saying. I don't know the people\n",
      "who wrote all the books and articles that I read in preparation for this talk. And I certainly don't know all the people who might be watching this talk\n",
      "over the Internet, somewhere in Buenos Aires or in New Delhi. Nevertheless, even though\n",
      "we don't know each other, we can work together to create\n",
      "this global exchange of ideas. This is something chimpanzees cannot do. They communicate, of course, but you will never catch a chimpanzee\n",
      "traveling to some distant chimpanzee band to give them a talk about bananas\n",
      "or about elephants, or anything else that might\n",
      "interest chimpanzees. Now cooperation is, of course,\n",
      "not always nice; all the horrible things humans\n",
      "have been doing throughout history -- and we have been doing\n",
      "some very horrible things -- all those things are also based\n",
      "on large-scale cooperation. Prisons are a system of cooperation; slaughterhouses are a system\n",
      "of cooperation; concentration camps\n",
      "are a system of cooperation. Chimpanzees don't have slaughterhouses\n",
      "and prisons and concentration camps. Now suppose I've managed\n",
      "to convince you perhaps that yes, we control the world because we can\n",
      "cooperate flexibly in large numbers. The next question that immediately arises in the mind of an inquisitive listener is: How, exactly, do we do it? What enables us alone, of all the animals,\n",
      "to cooperate in such a way? The answer is our imagination. We can cooperate flexibly\n",
      "with countless numbers of strangers, because we alone, of all\n",
      "the animals on the planet, can create and believe fictions,\n",
      "fictional stories. And as long as everybody believes\n",
      "in the same fiction, everybody obeys and follows\n",
      "the same rules, the same norms, the same values. All other animals use\n",
      "their communication system only to describe reality. A chimpanzee may say, \"Look!\n",
      "There's a lion, let's run away!\" Or, \"Look! There's a banana tree\n",
      "over there! Let's go and get bananas!\" Humans, in contrast, use their language\n",
      "not merely to describe reality, but also to create new realities,\n",
      "fictional realities. A human can say, \"Look,\n",
      "there is a god above the clouds! And if you don't do what I tell you to do, when you die, God will punish you\n",
      "and send you to hell.\" And if you all believe this story\n",
      "that I've invented, then you will follow the same\n",
      "norms and laws and values, and you can cooperate. This is something only humans can do. You can never convince a chimpanzee\n",
      "to give you a banana by promising him, \"... after you die,\n",
      "you'll go to chimpanzee heaven ...\" (Laughter) \"... and you'll receive lots and lots\n",
      "of bananas for your good deeds. So now give me this banana.\" No chimpanzee will ever\n",
      "believe such a story. Only humans believe such stories, which is why we control the world, whereas the chimpanzees are locked up\n",
      "in zoos and research laboratories. Now you may find it acceptable that yes, in the religious field, humans cooperate\n",
      "by believing in the same fictions. Millions of people come together\n",
      "to build a cathedral or a mosque or fight in a crusade or a jihad, because\n",
      "they all believe in the same stories about God and heaven and hell. But what I want to emphasize\n",
      "is that exactly the same mechanism underlies all other forms\n",
      "of mass-scale human cooperation, not only in the religious field. Take, for example, the legal field. Most legal systems today in the world\n",
      "are based on a belief in human rights. But what are human rights? Human rights, just like God and heaven,\n",
      "are just a story that we've invented. They are not an objective reality; they are not some biological effect\n",
      "about homo sapiens. Take a human being,\n",
      "cut him open, look inside, you will find the heart, the kidneys,\n",
      "neurons, hormones, DNA, but you won't find any rights. The only place you find rights\n",
      "are in the stories that we have invented and spread around\n",
      "over the last few centuries. They may be very positive stories,\n",
      "very good stories, but they're still just fictional stories\n",
      "that we've invented. The same is true of the political field. The most important factors\n",
      "in modern politics are states and nations. But what are states and nations? They are not an objective reality. A mountain is an objective reality. You can see it, you can touch it,\n",
      "you can even smell it. But a nation or a state, like Israel or Iran or France or Germany, this is just a story that we've invented and became extremely attached to. The same is true of the economic field. The most important actors today\n",
      "in the global economy are companies and corporations. Many of you today, perhaps, work\n",
      "for a corporation, like Google or Toyota or McDonald's. What exactly are these things? They are what lawyers call legal fictions. They are stories invented and maintained by the powerful wizards we call lawyers. (Laughter) And what do corporations do all day? Mostly, they try to make money. Yet, what is money? Again, money is not an objective reality;\n",
      "it has no objective value. Take this green piece\n",
      "of paper, the dollar bill. Look at it -- it has no value. You cannot eat it, you cannot drink it, you cannot wear it. But then came along\n",
      "these master storytellers -- the big bankers, the finance ministers, the prime ministers -- and they tell us a very convincing story: \"Look, you see this green piece of paper? It is actually worth 10 bananas.\" And if I believe it, and you believe it, and everybody believes it, it actually works. I can take this worthless piece of paper, go to the supermarket, give it to a complete stranger\n",
      "whom I've never met before, and get, in exchange, real bananas\n",
      "which I can actually eat. This is something amazing. You could never do it with chimpanzees. Chimpanzees trade, of course: \"Yes, you give me a coconut,\n",
      "I'll give you a banana.\" That can work. But, you give me\n",
      "a worthless piece of paper and you except me to give you a banana? No way! What do you think I am, a human? (Laughter) Money, in fact, is\n",
      "the most successful story ever invented and told by humans, because it is the only story\n",
      "everybody believes. Not everybody believes in God, not everybody believes in human rights, not everybody believes in nationalism, but everybody believes in money,\n",
      "and in the dollar bill. Take, even, Osama Bin Laden. He hated American politics\n",
      "and American religion and American culture, but he had no objection\n",
      "to American dollars. He was quite fond of them, actually. (Laughter) To conclude, then: We humans control the world\n",
      "because we live in a dual reality. All other animals live\n",
      "in an objective reality. Their reality consists\n",
      "of objective entities, like rivers and trees\n",
      "and lions and elephants. We humans, we also live\n",
      "in an objective reality. In our world, too, there are rivers\n",
      "and trees and lions and elephants. But over the centuries, we have constructed on top\n",
      "of this objective reality a second layer of fictional reality, a reality made of fictional entities, like nations, like gods,\n",
      "like money, like corporations. And what is amazing is that\n",
      "as history unfolded, this fictional reality became\n",
      "more and more powerful so that today, the most powerful\n",
      "forces in the world are these fictional entities. Today, the very survival of rivers\n",
      "and trees and lions and elephants depends on the decisions and wishes\n",
      "of fictional entities, like the United States, like Google,\n",
      "like the World Bank -- entities that exist only\n",
      "in our own imagination. Thank you. (Applause) Bruno Giussani: Yuval, you have\n",
      "a new book out. After Sapiens, you wrote another one, and it's out in Hebrew, but not\n",
      "yet translated into ... Yuval Noah Harari: I'm working on\n",

      "that we are experiencing right now not only will potentially\n",
      "make our lives better, but they will create -- and I quote you -- \"... new classes and new class struggles,\n",
      "just as the industrial revolution did.\" Can you elaborate for us? YNH: Yes. In the industrial revolution, we saw the creation of a new class\n",
      "of the urban proletariat. And much of the political and social\n",
      "history of the last 200 years involved what to do with this class,\n",
      "and the new problems and opportunities. Now, we see the creation of a new\n",
      "massive class of useless people. (Laughter) As computers become better and better\n",
      "in more and more fields, there is a distinct possibility that\n",
      "computers will out-perform us in most tasks and will make\n",
      "humans redundant. And then the big political\n",
      "and economic question of the 21st century will be, \"What do we need humans for?\", or at least, \"What do we need\n",
      "so many humans for?\" BG: Do you have an answer in the book? YNH: At present, the best guess\n",
      "we have is to keep them happy with drugs and computer games ... (Laughter) but this doesn't sound\n",
      "like a very appealing future. BG: Ok, so you're basically saying\n",
      "in the book and now, that for all the discussion\n",
      "about the growing evidence of significant economic inequality,\n",
      "we are just kind of at the beginning of the process? YNH: Again, it's not a prophecy; it's seeing all kinds\n",

      "of a new massive class of useless people. Another possibility is\n",
      "the division of humankind into different biological castes, with the rich being upgraded\n",
      "into virtual gods, and the poor being degraded\n",

      "Elon, hey, welcome back to TED. It's great to have you here. Elon Musk: Thanks for having me. CA: So, in the next half hour or so, we're going to spend some time exploring your vision for what\n",
      "an exciting future might look like, which I guess makes\n",
      "the first question a little ironic: Why are you boring? EM: Yeah. I ask myself that frequently. We're trying to dig a hole under LA, and this is to create the beginning of what will hopefully\n",
      "be a 3D network of tunnels to alleviate congestion. So right now, one of the most\n",
      "soul-destroying things is traffic. It affects people\n",
      "in every part of the world. It takes away so much of your life. It's horrible. It's particularly horrible in LA. (Laughter) CA: I think you've brought with you the first visualization\n",
      "that's been shown of this. Can I show this? EM: Yeah, absolutely.\n",
      "So this is the first time -- Just to show what we're talking about. So a couple of key things\n",
      "that are important in having a 3D tunnel network. First of all, you have to be able to integrate the entrance\n",
      "and exit of the tunnel seamlessly into the fabric of the city. So by having an elevator, sort of a car skate,\n",
      "that's on an elevator, you can integrate the entrance\n",
      "and exits to the tunnel network just by using two parking spaces. And then the car gets on a skate. There's no speed limit here, so we're designing this to be able\n",
      "to operate at 200 kilometers an hour. CA: How much? EM: 200 kilometers an hour,\n",
      "or about 130 miles per hour. So you should be able\n",
      "to get from, say, Westwood to LAX in six minutes -- five, six minutes. (Applause) CA: So possibly, initially done, it's like on a sort\n",
      "of toll road-type basis. EM: Yeah. CA: Which, I guess,\n",
      "alleviates some traffic from the surface streets as well. EM: So, I don't know\n",
      "if people noticed it in the video, but there's no real limit\n",
      "to how many levels of tunnel you can have. You can go much further deep\n",
      "than you can go up. The deepest mines are much deeper\n",
      "than the tallest buildings are tall, so you can alleviate any arbitrary\n",
      "level of urban congestion with a 3D tunnel network. This is a very important point. So a key rebuttal to the tunnels\n",
      "is that if you add one layer of tunnels, that will simply alleviate congestion,\n",
      "it will get used up, and then you'll be back where you started,\n",
      "back with congestion. But you can go to any\n",
      "arbitrary number of tunnels, any number of levels. CA: But people -- seen traditionally,\n",
      "it's incredibly expensive to dig, and that would block this idea. EM: Yeah. Well, they're right. To give you an example,\n",
      "the LA subway extension, which is -- I think it's\n",
      "a two-and-a-half mile extension that was just completed\n",
      "for two billion dollars. So it's roughly a billion dollars a mile\n",
      "to do the subway extension in LA. And this is not the highest\n",
      "utility subway in the world. So yeah, it's quite difficult\n",
      "to dig tunnels normally. I think we need to have\n",
      "at least a tenfold improvement in the cost per mile of tunneling. CA: And how could you achieve that? EM: Actually, if you just do two things, you can get to approximately\n",
      "an order of magnitude improvement, and I think you can go beyond that. So the first thing to do\n",
      "is to cut the tunnel diameter by a factor of two or more. So a single road lane tunnel\n",
      "according to regulations has to be 26 feet,\n",
      "maybe 28 feet in diameter to allow for crashes\n",
      "and emergency vehicles and sufficient ventilation\n",
      "for combustion engine cars. But if you shrink that diameter\n",
      "to what we're attempting, which is 12 feet, which is plenty\n",
      "to get an electric skate through, you drop the diameter by a factor of two and the cross-sectional area\n",
      "by a factor of four, and the tunneling cost scales\n",
      "with the cross-sectional area. So that's roughly a half-order\n",
      "of magnitude improvement right there. Then tunneling machines currently tunnel\n",
      "for half the time, then they stop, and then the rest of the time\n",
      "is putting in reinforcements for the tunnel wall. So if you design the machine instead to do continuous\n",
      "tunneling and reinforcing, that will give you\n",
      "a factor of two improvement. Combine that and that's a factor of eight. Also these machines are far from being\n",
      "at their power or thermal limits, so you can jack up the power\n",
      "to the machine substantially. I think you can get\n",
      "at least a factor of two, maybe a factor of four or five\n",
      "improvement on top of that. So I think there's a fairly\n",
      "straightforward series of steps to get somewhere in excess\n",
      "of an order of magnitude improvement in the cost per mile, and our target actually is -- we've got a pet snail called Gary, this is from Gary the snail\n",
      "from \"South Park,\" I mean, sorry, \"SpongeBob SquarePants.\" (Laughter) So Gary is capable of -- currently he's capable\n",
      "of going 14 times faster than a tunnel-boring machine. (Laughter) CA: You want to beat Gary. EM: We want to beat Gary. (Laughter) He's not a patient little fellow, and that will be victory. Victory is beating the snail. CA: But a lot of people imagining,\n",
      "dreaming about future cities, they imagine that actually\n",
      "the solution is flying cars, drones, etc. You go aboveground. Why isn't that a better solution? You save all that tunneling cost. EM: Right. I'm in favor of flying things. Obviously, I do rockets,\n",
      "so I like things that fly. This is not some inherent bias\n",
      "against flying things, but there is a challenge with flying cars in that they'll be quite noisy, the wind force generated\n",
      "will be very high. Let's just say that if something's\n",
      "flying over your head, a whole bunch of flying cars\n",
      "going all over the place, that is not an anxiety-reducing situation. (Laughter) You don't think to yourself,\n",
      "\"Well, I feel better about today.\" You're thinking,\n",
      "\"Did they service their hubcap, or is it going to come off\n",
      "and guillotine me?\" Things like that. CA: So you've got this vision of future cities with these rich,\n",
      "3D networks of tunnels underneath. Is there a tie-in here with Hyperloop? Could you apply these tunnels\n",
      "to use for this Hyperloop idea you released a few years ago. EM: Yeah, so we've been\n",
      "sort of puttering around with the Hyperloop stuff for a while. We built a Hyperloop test track\n",
      "adjacent to SpaceX, just for a student competition, to encourage innovative\n",
      "ideas in transport. And it actually ends up being\n",
      "the biggest vacuum chamber in the world after the Large Hadron Collider, by volume. So it was quite fun to do that,\n",
      "but it was kind of a hobby thing, and then we think we might -- so we've built a little pusher car\n",
      "to push the student pods, but we're going to try seeing\n",
      "how fast we can make the pusher go if it's not pushing something. So we're cautiously optimistic we'll be able to be faster\n",
      "than the world's fastest bullet train even in a .8-mile stretch. CA: Whoa. Good brakes. EM: Yeah, I mean, it's -- yeah. It's either going to smash\n",
      "into tiny pieces or go quite fast. CA: But you can picture,\n",
      "then, a Hyperloop in a tunnel running quite long distances. EM: Exactly. And looking at tunneling technology, it turns out that\n",
      "in order to make a tunnel, you have to -- In order to seal against the water table, you've got to typically design\n",
      "a tunnel wall to be good to about five or six atmospheres. So to go to vacuum is only one atmosphere, or near-vacuum. So actually, it sort of turns out\n",
      "that automatically, if you build a tunnel that is good enough\n",
      "to resist the water table, it is automatically\n",
      "capable of holding vacuum. CA: Huh. EM: So, yeah. CA: And so you could actually picture, what kind of length tunnel\n",
      "is in Elon's future to running Hyperloop? EM: I think there's no real length limit. You could dig as much as you want. I think if you were to do something like a DC-to-New York Hyperloop, I think you'd probably want\n",
      "to go underground the entire way because it's a high-density area. You're going under\n",
      "a lot of buildings and houses, and if you go deep enough, you cannot detect the tunnel. Sometimes people think,\n",
      "well, it's going to be pretty annoying to have a tunnel dug under my house. Like, if that tunnel is dug more than about three or four\n",
      "tunnel diameters beneath your house, you will not be able\n",
      "to detect it being dug at all. In fact, if you're able\n",
      "to detect the tunnel being dug, whatever device you are using, you can get a lot of money\n",
      "for that device from the Israeli military, who is trying to detect\n",
      "tunnels from Hamas, and from the US Customs and Border patrol\n",
      "that try and detect drug tunnels. So the reality is that earth is incredibly good\n",
      "at absorbing vibrations, and once the tunnel depth\n",
      "is below a certain level, it is undetectable. Maybe if you have a very sensitive\n",
      "seismic instrument, you might be able to detect it. CA: So you've started\n",
      "a new company to do this called The Boring Company. Very nice. Very funny. (Laughter) EM: What's funny about that? (Laughter) CA: How much of your time is this? EM: It's maybe ... two or three percent. CA: You've bought a hobby. This is what an Elon Musk\n",
      "hobby looks like. (Laughter) EM: I mean, it really is, like -- This is basically interns\n",
      "and people doing it part time. We bought some second-hand machinery. It's kind of puttering along,\n",
      "but it's making good progress, so -- CA: So an even bigger part of your time is being spent on electrifying\n",
      "cars and transport through Tesla. Is one of the motivations\n",
      "for the tunneling project the realization that actually, in a world where cars are electric\n",
      "and where they're self-driving, there may end up being\n",
      "more cars on the roads on any given hour than there are now? EM: Yeah, exactly. A lot of people think\n",
      "that when you make cars autonomous, they'll be able to go faster\n",
      "and that will alleviate congestion. And to some degree that will be true, but once you have shared autonomy\n",
      "where it's much cheaper to go by car and you can go point to point, the affordability of going in a car\n",
      "will be better than that of a bus. Like, it will cost less than a bus ticket. So the amount of driving that will occur\n",
      "will be much greater with shared autonomy, and actually traffic will get far worse. CA: You started Tesla\n",
      "with the goal of persuading the world that electrification\n",
      "was the future of cars, and a few years ago,\n",
      "people were laughing at you. Now, not so much. EM: OK. (Laughter) I don't know. I don't know. CA: But isn't it true that pretty much\n",
      "every auto manufacturer has announced\n",
      "serious electrification plans for the short- to medium-term future? EM: Yeah. Yeah. I think almost every automaker\n",
      "has some electric vehicle program. They vary in seriousness. Some are very serious\n",
      "about transitioning entirely to electric, and some are just dabbling in it. And some, amazingly,\n",
      "are still pursuing fuel cells, but I think that won't last much longer. CA: But isn't there a sense, though, Elon, where you can now just declare victory\n",
      "and say, you know, \"We did it.\" Let the world electrify,\n",
      "and you go on and focus on other stuff? EM: Yeah. I intend to stay with Tesla\n",
      "as far into the future as I can imagine, and there are a lot of exciting\n",
      "things that we have coming. Obviously the Model 3 is coming soon. We'll be unveiling the Tesla Semi truck. CA: OK, we're going to come to this. So Model 3, it's supposed\n",
      "to be coming in July-ish. EM: Yeah, it's looking quite good\n",
      "for starting production in July. CA: Wow. One of the things\n",
      "that people are so excited about is the fact that it's got autopilot. And you put out this video a while back showing what that technology\n",
      "would look like. EM: Yeah. CA: There's obviously autopilot\n",
      "in Model S right now. What are we seeing here? EM: Yeah, so this is using\n",
      "only cameras and GPS. So there's no LIDAR\n",
      "or radar being used here. This is just using passive optical,\n",
      "which is essentially what a person uses. The whole road system\n",
      "is meant to be navigated with passive optical, or cameras, and so once you solve cameras or vision, then autonomy is solved. If you don't solve vision,\n",
      "it's not solved. So that's why our focus is\n",
      "so heavily on having a vision neural net that's very effective for road conditions. CA: Right. Many other people\n",
      "are going the LIDAR route. You want cameras plus radar is most of it. EM: You can absolutely\n",
      "be superhuman with just cameras. Like, you can probably do it\n",
      "ten times better than humans would, just cameras. CA: So the new cars being sold right now\n",
      "have eight cameras in them. They can't yet do what that showed. When will they be able to? EM: I think we're still on track\n",
      "for being able to go cross-country from LA to New York by the end\n",
      "of the year, fully autonomous. CA: OK, so by the end\n",
      "of the year, you're saying, someone's going to sit in a Tesla\n",
      "without touching the steering wheel, tap in \"New York,\" off it goes. EM: Yeah. CA: Won't ever have to touch the wheel --\n",
      "by the end of 2017. EM: Yeah. Essentially,\n",
      "November or December of this year, we should be able to go all the way\n",
      "from a parking lot in California to a parking lot in New York, no controls touched at any point\n",
      "during the entire journey. (Applause) CA: Amazing. But part of that is possible because you've already got a fleet\n",
      "of Teslas driving all these roads. You're accumulating a huge amount\n",
      "of data of that national road system. EM: Yes, but the thing\n",
      "that will be interesting is that I'm actually fairly confident\n",
      "it will be able to do that route even if you change the route dynamically. So, it's fairly easy -- If you say I'm going to be really good\n",
      "at one specific route, that's one thing, but it should be able to go,\n",
      "really be very good, certainly once you enter a highway, to go anywhere on the highway system in a given country. So it's not sort of limited\n",
      "to LA to New York. We could change it\n",
      "and make it Seattle-Florida, that day, in real time. So you were going from LA to New York. Now go from LA to Toronto. CA: So leaving aside\n",
      "regulation for a second, in terms of the technology alone, the time when someone\n",
      "will be able to buy one of your cars and literally just take the hands\n",
      "off the wheel and go to sleep and wake up and find that they've arrived, how far away is that, to do that safely? EM: I think that's about two years. So the real trick of it\n",
      "is not how do you make it work say 99.9 percent of the time, because, like, if a car crashes\n",
      "one in a thousand times, then you're probably still not going\n",
      "to be comfortable falling asleep. You shouldn't be, certainly. (Laughter) It's never going to be perfect. No system is going to be perfect, but if you say it's perhaps -- the car is unlikely to crash in a hundred lifetimes,\n",
      "or a thousand lifetimes, then people are like, OK, wow,\n",
      "if I were to live a thousand lives, I would still most likely\n",
      "never experience a crash, then that's probably OK. CA: To sleep. I guess the big concern of yours\n",
      "is that people may actually get seduced too early\n",
      "to think that this is safe, and that you'll have some horrible\n",
      "incident happen that puts things back. EM: Well, I think that the autonomy system\n",
      "is likely to at least mitigate the crash, except in rare circumstances. The thing to appreciate\n",
      "about vehicle safety is this is probabilistic. I mean, there's some chance that any time\n",
      "a human driver gets in a car, that they will have an accident\n",
      "that is their fault. It's never zero. So really the key threshold for autonomy is how much better does autonomy\n",
      "need to be than a person before you can rely on it? CA: But once you get\n",
      "literally safe hands-off driving, the power to disrupt\n",
      "the whole industry seems massive, because at that point you've spoken\n",
      "of people being able to buy a car, drops you off at work,\n",
      "and then you let it go and provide a sort of Uber-like\n",
      "service to other people, earn you money, maybe even cover the cost\n",
      "of your lease of that car, so you can kind of get a car for free. Is that really likely? EM: Yeah. Absolutely\n",
      "this is what will happen. So there will be a shared autonomy fleet where you buy your car and you can choose\n",
      "to use that car exclusively, you could choose to have it be used\n",
      "only by friends and family, only by other drivers\n",
      "who are rated five star, you can choose to share it sometimes\n",
      "but not other times. That's 100 percent what will occur. It's just a question of when. CA: Wow. So you mentioned the Semi and I think you're planning\n",
      "to announce this in September, but I'm curious whether there's\n",
      "anything you could show us today? EM: I will show you\n",
      "a teaser shot of the truck. (Laughter) It's alive. CA: OK. EM: That's definitely a case\n",
      "where we want to be cautious about the autonomy features. Yeah. (Laughter) CA: We can't see that much of it, but it doesn't look like\n",
      "just a little friendly neighborhood truck. It looks kind of badass. What sort of semi is this? EM: So this is a heavy duty,\n",
      "long-range semitruck. So it's the highest weight capability and with long range. So essentially it's meant to alleviate\n",
      "the heavy-duty trucking loads. And this is something which\n",
      "people do not today think is possible. They think the truck doesn't have enough\n",
      "power or it doesn't have enough range, and then with the Tesla Semi we want to show that no, an electric truck actually can out-torque any diesel semi. And if you had a tug-of-war competition, the Tesla Semi\n",
      "will tug the diesel semi uphill. (Laughter) (Applause) CA: That's pretty cool.\n",
      "And short term, these aren't driverless. These are going to be trucks\n",
      "that truck drivers want to drive. EM: Yes. So what will be\n",
      "really fun about this is you have a flat torque RPM curve\n",
      "with an electric motor, whereas with a diesel motor or any kind\n",
      "of internal combustion engine car, you've got a torque RPM curve\n",
      "that looks like a hill. So this will be a very spry truck. You can drive this\n",
      "around like a sports car. There's no gears.\n",
      "It's, like, single speed. CA: There's a great movie\n",
      "to be made here somewhere. I don't know what it is\n",
      "and I don't know that it ends well, but it's a great movie. (Laughter) EM: It's quite bizarre test-driving. When I was driving the test prototype\n",
      "for the first truck. It's really weird,\n",
      "because you're driving around and you're just so nimble,\n",
      "and you're in this giant truck. CA: Wait, you've\n",
      "already driven a prototype? EM: Yeah, I drove it\n",
      "around the parking lot, and I was like, this is crazy. CA: Wow. This is no vaporware. EM: It's just like,\n",
      "driving this giant truck and making these mad maneuvers. CA: This is cool.\n",
      "OK, from a really badass picture to a kind of less badass picture. This is just a cute house\n",
      "from \"Desperate Housewives\" or something. What on earth is going on here? EM: Well, this illustrates\n",
      "the picture of the future that I think is how things will evolve. You've got an electric car\n",
      "in the driveway. If you look in between\n",
      "the electric car and the house, there are actually three Powerwalls\n",
      "stacked up against the side of the house, and then that house roof is a solar roof. So that's an actual solar glass roof. CA: OK. EM: That's a picture of a real --\n",
      "well, admittedly, it's a real fake house. That's a real fake house. (Laughter) CA: So these roof tiles, some of them have in them\n",
      "basically solar power, the ability to -- EM: Yeah. Solar glass tiles where you can adjust\n",
      "the texture and the color to a very fine-grained level, and then there's\n",
      "sort of microlouvers in the glass, such that when you're looking\n",
      "at the roof from street level or close to street level, all the tiles look the same whether there is a solar cell\n",
      "behind it or not. So you have an even color from the ground level. If you were to look at it\n",
      "from a helicopter, you would be actually able\n",
      "to look through and see that some of the glass tiles have\n",
      "a solar cell behind them and some do not. You can't tell from street level. CA: You put them in the ones\n",
      "that are likely to see a lot of sun, and that makes these roofs\n",
      "super affordable, right? They're not that much more expensive\n",
      "than just tiling the roof. EM: Yeah. We're very confident\n",
      "that the cost of the roof plus the cost of electricity -- A solar glass roof will be less\n",
      "than the cost of a normal roof plus the cost of electricity. So in other words, this will be economically a no-brainer, we think it will look great, and it will last -- We thought about having\n",
      "the warranty be infinity, but then people thought, well, that might sound\n",
      "like were just talking rubbish, but actually this is toughened glass. Well after the house has collapsed and there's nothing there, the glass tiles will still be there. (Applause) CA: I mean, this is cool. So you're rolling this out\n",
      "in a couple week's time, I think, with four different roofing types. EM: Yeah, we're starting off\n",
      "with two, two initially, and the second two\n",
      "will be introduced early next year. CA: And what's the scale of ambition here? How many houses do you believe\n",
      "could end up having this type of roofing? EM: I think eventually almost all houses will have a solar roof. The thing is to consider\n",
      "the time scale here to be probably on the order of 40 or 50 years. So on average, a roof\n",
      "is replaced every 20 to 25 years. But you don't start replacing\n",
      "all roofs immediately. But eventually,\n",

      "a diamond shape overall, and when it's fully done,\n",
      "it'll look like a giant diamond, or that's the idea behind it, and it's aligned on true north. It's a small detail. CA: And capable of producing, eventually, like a hundred gigawatt hours\n",
      "of batteries a year. EM: A hundred gigawatt hours.\n",
      "We think probably more, but yeah. CA: And they're actually\n",
      "being produced right now. EM: They're in production already.\n",
      "CA: You guys put out this video. I mean, is that speeded up? EM: That's the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: How fast does it actually go? EM: Well, when it's running at full speed, you can't actually see the cells\n",
      "without a strobe light. It's just blur. (Laughter) CA: One of your core ideas, Elon,\n",

      "feel guilty about energy. Help us picture this. How many Gigafactories, if you like,\n",
      "does it take to get us there? EM: It's about a hundred, roughly. It's not 10, it's not a thousand. Most likely a hundred. CA: See, I find this amazing. You can picture what it would take to move the world\n",
      "off this vast fossil fuel thing. It's like you're building one, it costs five billion dollars, or whatever, five to 10 billion dollars. Like, it's kind of cool\n",
      "that you can picture that project. And you're planning to do, at Tesla --\n",
      "announce another two this year. EM: I think we'll announce locations for somewhere between two\n",
      "and four Gigafactories later this year. Yeah, probably four. CA: Whoa. (Applause) No more teasing from you for here? Like -- where, continent? You can say no. EM: We need to address a global market. CA: OK. (Laughter) This is cool. I think we should talk for -- Actually, double mark it. I'm going to ask you one question\n",
      "about politics, only one. I'm kind of sick of politics,\n",
      "but I do want to ask you this. You're on a body now\n",
      "giving advice to a guy -- EM: Who? CA: Who has said he doesn't\n",
      "really believe in climate change, and there's a lot of people out there\n",
      "who think you shouldn't be doing that. They'd like you to walk away from that. What would you say to them? EM: Well, I think that first of all, I'm just on two advisory councils where the format consists\n",
      "of going around the room and asking people's opinion on things, and so there's like a meeting\n",
      "every month or two. That's the sum total of my contribution. But I think to the degree\n",
      "that there are people in the room who are arguing in favor\n",
      "of doing something about climate change, or social issues, I've used the meetings I've had thus far to argue in favor of immigration\n",
      "and in favor of climate change. (Applause) And if I hadn't done that, that wasn't on the agenda before. So maybe nothing will happen,\n",
      "but at least the words were said. CA: OK. (Applause) So let's talk SpaceX and Mars. Last time you were here, you spoke about what seemed like\n",
      "a kind of incredibly ambitious dream to develop rockets\n",
      "that were actually reusable. And you've only gone and done it. EM: Finally. It took a long time. CA: Talk us through this.\n",
      "What are we looking at here? EM: So this is one of our rocket boosters coming back from\n",
      "very high and fast in space. So just delivered the upper stage at high velocity. I think this might have been\n",
      "at sort of Mach 7 or so, delivery of the upper stage. (Applause) CA: So that was a sped-up -- EM: That was the slowed down version. (Laughter) CA: I thought that was\n",
      "the sped-up version. But I mean, that's amazing, and several of these failed before you finally\n",
      "figured out how to do it, but now you've done this,\n",
      "what, five or six times? EM: We're at eight or nine. CA: And for the first time, you've actually reflown\n",
      "one of the rockets that landed. EM: Yeah, so we landed the rocket booster and then prepped it for flight again\n",
      "and flew it again, so it's the first reflight\n",
      "of an orbital booster where that reflight is relevant. So it's important to appreciate\n",
      "that reusability is only relevant if it is rapid and complete. So like an aircraft or a car, the reusability is rapid and complete. You do not send your aircraft\n",
      "to Boeing in-between flights. CA: Right. So this is allowing you\n",
      "to dream of this really ambitious idea of sending many, many, many people to Mars in, what, 10 or 20 years time, I guess. EM: Yeah. CA: And you've designed\n",
      "this outrageous rocket to do it. Help us understand\n",
      "the scale of this thing. EM: Well, visually\n",
      "you can see that's a person. Yeah, and that's the vehicle. (Laughter) CA: So if that was a skyscraper, that's like, did I read that,\n",
      "a 40-story skyscraper? EM: Probably a little more, yeah. The thrust level of this is really -- This configuration is about four times\n",
      "the thrust of the Saturn V moon rocket. CA: Four times the thrust of the biggest\n",
      "rocket humanity ever created before. EM: Yeah. Yeah. CA: As one does.\n",
      "EM: Yeah. (Laughter) In units of 747, a 747 is only about\n",
      "a quarter of a million pounds of thrust, so for every 10 million pounds of thrust, there's 40 747s. So this would be the thrust equivalent\n",
      "of 120 747s, with all engines blazing. CA: And so even with a machine\n",
      "designed to escape Earth's gravity, I think you told me last time this thing could actually\n",
      "take a fully loaded 747, people, cargo, everything, into orbit. EM: Exactly. This can take\n",
      "a fully loaded 747 with maximum fuel, maximum passengers,\n",
      "maximum cargo on the 747 -- this can take it as cargo. CA: So based on this, you presented recently\n",
      "this Interplanetary Transport System which is visualized this way. This is a scene you picture in, what,\n",
      "30 years time? 20 years time? People walking into this rocket. EM: I'm hopeful it's sort of\n",
      "an eight- to 10-year time frame. Aspirationally, that's our target. Our internal targets\n",
      "are more aggressive, but I think -- (Laughter) CA: OK. EM: While vehicle seems quite large and is large by comparison\n",
      "with other rockets, I think the future spacecraft will make this look like a rowboat. The future spaceships\n",
      "will be truly enormous. CA: Why, Elon? Why do we need to build a city on Mars with a million people\n",
      "on it in your lifetime, which I think is kind of\n",
      "what you've said you'd love to do? EM: I think it's important to have a future that is inspiring and appealing. I just think there have to be reasons that you get up in the morning\n",
      "and you want to live. Like, why do you want to live? What's the point? What inspires you? What do you love about the future? And if we're not out there, if the future does not include\n",
      "being out there among the stars and being a multiplanet species, I find that it's incredibly depressing if that's not the future\n",
      "that we're going to have. (Applause) CA: People want to position this\n",

      "happening on the planet now from climate to poverty\n",
      "to, you know, you pick your issue. And this feels like a distraction. You shouldn't be thinking about this. You should be solving what's here and now. And to be fair, you've done\n",
      "a fair old bit to actually do that with your work on sustainable energy. But why not just do that? EM: I think there's -- I look at the future\n",
      "from the standpoint of probabilities. It's like a branching\n",
      "stream of probabilities, and there are actions that we can take\n",
      "that affect those probabilities or that accelerate one thing\n",
      "or slow down another thing. I may introduce something new\n",
      "to the probability stream. Sustainable energy\n",
      "will happen no matter what. If there was no Tesla,\n",
      "if Tesla never existed, it would have to happen out of necessity. It's tautological. If you don't have sustainable energy,\n",
      "it means you have unsustainable energy. Eventually you will run out, and the laws of economics\n",
      "will drive civilization towards sustainable energy, inevitably. The fundamental value\n",
      "of a company like Tesla is the degree to which it accelerates\n",
      "the advent of sustainable energy, faster than it would otherwise occur. So when I think, like, what is the fundamental good\n",
      "of a company like Tesla, I would say, hopefully, if it accelerated that by a decade,\n",
      "potentially more than a decade, that would be quite a good thing to occur. That's what I consider to be the fundamental\n",
      "aspirational good of Tesla. Then there's becoming a multiplanet\n",
      "species and space-faring civilization. This is not inevitable. It's very important to appreciate\n",
      "this is not inevitable. The sustainable energy future\n",
      "I think is largely inevitable, but being a space-faring civilization\n",
      "is definitely not inevitable. If you look at the progress in space, in 1969 you were able\n",
      "to send somebody to the moon. 1969. Then we had the Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle could only\n",
      "take people to low Earth orbit. Then the Space Shuttle retired, and the United States\n",
      "could take no one to orbit. So that's the trend. The trend is like down to nothing. People are mistaken when they think that technology\n",
      "just automatically improves. It does not automatically improve. It only improves if a lot of people\n",
      "work very hard to make it better, and actually it will, I think,\n",
      "by itself degrade, actually. You look at great civilizations\n",
      "like Ancient Egypt, and they were able to make the pyramids, and they forgot how to do that. And then the Romans,\n",
      "they built these incredible aqueducts. They forgot how to do it. CA: Elon, it almost seems,\n",
      "listening to you and looking at the different\n",
      "things you've done, that you've got this unique\n",
      "double motivation on everything that I find so interesting. One is this desire to work\n",
      "for humanity's long-term good. The other is the desire\n",
      "to do something exciting. And often it feels like you feel\n",
      "like you need the one to drive the other. With Tesla, you want\n",
      "to have sustainable energy, so you made these super sexy,\n",
      "exciting cars to do it. Solar energy, we need to get there, so we need to make these beautiful roofs. We haven't even spoken\n",
      "about your newest thing, which we don't have time to do, but you want to save humanity from bad AI, and so you're going to create\n",
      "this really cool brain-machine interface to give us all infinite memory\n",
      "and telepathy and so forth. And on Mars, it feels\n",
      "like what you're saying is, yeah, we need to save humanity and have a backup plan, but also we need to inspire humanity, and this is a way to inspire. EM: I think the value\n",
      "of beauty and inspiration is very much underrated, no question. But I want to be clear. I'm not trying to be anyone's savior. That is not the -- I'm just trying to think about the future and not be sad. (Applause) CA: Beautiful statement. I think everyone here would agree that it is not -- None of this is going\n",

      "you dream this stuff, you dream stuff that no one else\n",

      "The great philosopher Aristotle said if something doesn't exist,\n",
      "there's no word for it, and if there's no word for something, that something doesn't exist. So when we talk about elections, we in established democracies,\n",
      "we know what we're talking about. We've got the words.\n",

      "no words to describe the concepts that underpin a democratic society? I work in the field\n",
      "of electoral assistance, so that's to say we assist emerging democracies to organize what is often their first elections. When people ask me what I do, quite often I get this answer. \"Oh, so you're one of these people\n",
      "who goes around the world imposing Western democracy\n",
      "on countries that can't handle it.\" Well, the United Nations\n",
      "does not impose anything on anybody. It really doesn't, and also, what we do is firmly anchored in the 1948\n",
      "Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Article 21, that says that everybody should have the right\n",
      "to choose who governs them. So that's the basis of the work. I specialize in public outreach. What does that mean? Another jargon. It actually means\n",
      "designing information campaigns so that candidates and voters who have never had the opportunity\n",
      "to participate or to vote understand where, when, how to register; where, when, how to vote; why, why it is important to take part. So I'll probably devise a specific\n",
      "campaign to reach out to women to make sure that they can take part, that they can be part of the process. Young people as well. All sorts of people. Handicapped people. We try to reach everybody. And it's not always easy,\n",
      "because very often in this work, I've noticed now over the years\n",
      "that I've been doing it that words are lacking, and so what do you do? Afghanistan. It's a country with\n",
      "high levels of illiteracy, and the thing about that was,\n",
      "it was in 2005, and we organized two elections\n",
      "on the same day. The reason was because the logistics\n",
      "are so incredibly difficult, it seemed to be more efficient to do that. It was, but on the other hand,\n",
      "explaining two elections instead of one was even more complicated. So we used a lot of images, and when it came to the actual ballot, we had problems, because\n",
      "so many people wanted to take part, we had 300 candidates for 52 seats in the Wolesi Jirga,\n",
      "which is the parliamentary elections. And for the Provincial Council,\n",
      "we had even more candidates. We had 330 for 54 seats. So talking about ballot design, this is what the ballot looked like. It's the size of a newspaper. This was the Wolesi Jirga ballot -- (Laughter) Yeah, and -- this was the Provincial Council ballot. Even more. So you see, we did use\n",
      "a lot of symbols and things like that. And we had other problems\n",
      "in Southern Sudan. Southern Sudan was a very different story. We had so many people\n",
      "who had never, of course, voted, but we had extremely, extremely\n",
      "high levels of illiteracy, very, very poor infrastructure. For example -- I mean, it's a country\n",
      "the size of Texas, more or less. We had seven kilometers of paved roads, seven kilometers in the whole country, and that includes the tarmac\n",
      "where we landed the planes in Juba Airport. So transporting electoral materials, etc., is exceedingly difficult. People had no idea\n",
      "about what a box looked like. It was very complicated, so using verbal communication\n",
      "was obviously the way to go, but there were 132 languages. So that was extremely challenging. Then I arrived in Tunisia in 2011. It was the Arab Spring. A huge amount of hope was generated\n",
      "by that enormous movement that was going on in the region. There was Libya,\n",
      "there was Egypt, there was Yemen. It was an enormous, enormous\n",
      "historical moment. And I was sitting\n",
      "with the election commission, and we were talking\n",
      "about various aspects of the election, and I was hearing them using words\n",
      "that I hadn't actually heard before, and I'd worked with Iraqis,\n",
      "I'd worked with Jordanians, Egyptians, and suddenly they were using these words, and I just thought, \"This is strange.\" And what really gave rise to it\n",
      "was this word \"observer.\" We were discussing election observers, and the election commissioner\n",
      "was talking about \"mulahiz\" in Arabic. This means \"to notice\"\n",
      "in a passive sort of sense, as in, \"I noticed\n",
      "he was wearing a light blue shirt.\" Did I go and check whether\n",
      "the shirt was light blue or not? That is the role of an election observer. It's very active, it's governed\n",
      "by all kinds of treaties, and it has got\n",
      "that control function in it. And then I got wind\n",
      "of the fact that in Egypt, they were using this term \"mutabi’,\"\n",
      "which means \"to follow.\" So we were now having\n",
      "followers of an election. So that's not quite right either, because there is a term\n",
      "that's already accepted and in use, which was the word \"muraqib\"\n",
      "which means \"a controller.\" It's got that notion of control. So I thought, three words\n",
      "for one concept. This is not good. And with our colleagues,\n",
      "we thought perhaps it's our role to actually help make sure\n",
      "that the words are understood and actually create a work of reference that could be used across the Arab region. And that's what we did. So together with these colleagues, we launched the \"Arabic Lexicon\n",
      "of Electoral Terminology,\" and we worked\n",
      "in eight different countries. It meant actually defining 481 terms which formed the basis\n",
      "of everything you need to know if you're going to organize\n",
      "a democratic election. And we defined these terms, and we worked with the Arab colleagues and came to an agreement\n",
      "about what would be the appropriate word to use in Arabic. Because the Arabic language is very rich,\n",
      "and that's part of the problem. But there are 22 countries\n",
      "that speak Arabic, and they use modern standard Arabic, which is the Arabic\n",
      "that is used across the whole region in newspapers and broadcasts, but of course, then from one country\n",
      "to the next in day to day language and use it varies -- dialect, colloquialisms, etc. So that was another\n",
      "added layer of complication. So in one sense you had the problem that language wasn't\n",
      "fully ripe, if you like, neologisms were coming up,\n",
      "new expressions. And so we defined all these terms, and then we had\n",
      "eight correspondents in the region. We submitted the draft to them, they responded back to us. \"Yes, we understand the definition. We agree with it, but this is what we say in our country.\" Because we were not going\n",
      "to harmonize or force harmonization. We were trying to facilitate\n",
      "understanding among people. So in yellow, you see\n",
      "the different expressions in use in the various countries. So this, I'm happy to say,\n",
      "it took three years to produce this because we also finalized the draft\n",
      "and took it actually into the field, sat with the election commissions\n",
      "in all these different countries, debated and defined and refined the draft, and finally published it\n",
      "in November 2014 in Cairo. And it's gone a long way.\n",
      "We published 10,000 copies. To date, there's about 3,000 downloads\n",
      "off the internet in PDF form. I heard just recently from a colleague\n",
      "that they've taken it up in Somalia. They're going to produce\n",
      "a version of this in Somalia, because there's nothing in Somalia at all. So that's very good to know. And this newly formed Arab Organization\n",
      "for Electoral Management Bodies, which is trying to professionalize how elections are run in the region, they're using it as well. And the Arab League have now\n",
      "built up a pan-Arab observation unit, and they're using it. So that's all really good. However, this work of reference\n",
      "is quite high-pitched. It's complex, and a lot of the terms\n",
      "are quite technical, so the average person probably doesn't\n",
      "need to know at least a third of it. But the people of the Middle East have been deprived of any form\n",
      "of what we know as civic education. It's part of our curriculum at school. It doesn't really exist\n",
      "in that part of the world, and I feel it's really\n",
      "the right of everybody to know how these things work. And it's a good thing to think about\n",
      "producing a work of reference for the average person, and bearing in mind that now we have a basis to work with, but also we have technology, so we can reach out using telephone apps, video, animation. There's all sorts of tools\n",
      "that can be used now to communicate these ideas to people for the first time in their own language. We hear a lot of misery\n",
      "about the Middle East. We hear the chaos of war.\n",
      "We hear terrorism. We hear about sectarianism\n",
      "and all this horrible negative news that comes to us all the time. What we're not hearing is what are\n",
      "the people, the everyday people, thinking? What are they aspiring to? Let's give them the means,\n",
      "let's give them the words. The silent majority is silent because they don't have the words. The silent majority needs to know. It is time to provide people\n",
